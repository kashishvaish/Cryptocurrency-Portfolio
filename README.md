# Cryptocurrency-Portfolio
## INTRODUCTION
CryptoCurrency Portfolio desktop application using Python, Tkinter, SQLite and CoinMarketCap API – A desktop application in which you can keep track of profit or loss on your CryptoCurrency with changes in the market value.
## What is a Cryptocurrency Portfolio
Each cryptocurrency has its own value, which can change drastically with little notice. Cryptocurrency markets trade around the clock, which means that the value of your coins may shift overnight or on a weekend or holiday. As you become a more experienced investor, you may have trouble keeping up with the value of each of your coins. Cryptocurrency portfolio trackers show changes in your portfolio and allow you to see how much money you have at a glance. Portfolio trackers are an essential tool for both casual and professional cryptocurrency investors because they allow you to monitor price changes at all hours of the day and track your investments over time.
A cryptocurrency portfolio tracker is a website, app or another type of platform that allows you to manage your investments and keep track of how the value of your coins are changing.
